/*
ðŸ”„ Java Example with ReentrantReadWriteLock
Java implements shared and exclusive locking using the ReentrantReadWriteLock.

âœ… Shared Lock (readLock()):
Allows multiple threads to read concurrently, but blocks when a writer is active.

âœ… Exclusive Lock (writeLock()):
Only one writer can acquire it, and no readers or other writers can proceed.


âœ… Real-World Use Case:
Cache access (read-heavy system)
Configuration access (read many times, updated occasionally)

It has two separate locks:
readLock() â†’ for read operations
writeLock() â†’ for write operations
 */

/*
ðŸ’¡ Real-Life Analogy:
Shared Lock = Public library: many people can read the same book at once.
Exclusive Lock = Editor: only one person can make changes, and others must wait.
