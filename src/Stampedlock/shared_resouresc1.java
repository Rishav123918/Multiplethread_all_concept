/*
This line does not block or acquire a traditional lock ‚Äî it simply assumes that no other thread will write to the variable a during the read and update operation.
This is called optimistic locking.

| Method       | Lock Type           | Description                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `producer()` | ‚úÖ Optimistic Lock   | Assumes no conflict; checks later with `validate()` |
| `consume()`  | üîí Pessimistic Lock | Acquires exclusive write lock to update             |


The read operation (producer()) is not stopped while a write is happening,
but its result may be invalid, so it will rollback if validate() fails.


üîÅ What Happens at Runtime?
Let‚Äôs say both producer() and consume() run concurrently:
producer() calls tryOptimisticRead() ‚Äî it proceeds assuming no one will write.
consume() then grabs the writeLock() and updates a.
After sleeping 10 seconds, producer() calls validate(stamp).
Since a write happened, validate() returns false.
producer() rolls back its changes.
‚úÖ So:
Read is not blocked, but it will detect interference later and rollback
Write is exclusive, and blocks real readers (like readLock()), but not optimistic ones.
